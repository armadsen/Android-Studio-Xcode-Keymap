# Android-Studio-Xcode-Keymap

This repository includes a keymap file for Android Studio (itself based on IntelliJ), along with a script to install it.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/armadsen/Android-Studio-Xcode-Keymap.git
$ cd ./Android-Studio-Xcode-Keymap
$ ./install.sh
```

You can also manually install the keymap by copying `Keymap_Xcode.xml` into `~/Library/Preferences/AndroidStudio<Version>/keymaps`. You'll have to create the `keymaps` directory if it doesn't already exist.
